# JS Piano

JS Piano is a personal project created while learning JavaScript. It's a simple 12-key piano implemented entirely in JavaScript. The project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to experiment with musical sounds in the browser.

## Features

- 12 keys for a full musical octave, both white and black keys.
- Click on keys to produce sounds.
- Play the piano using your computer keyboard.
- A user-friendly interface with visual key feedback.

## Credits

The frontend design of the piano is based on code from [this CodePen project](https://codepen.io/zastrow/pen/kxdYdk), with added functionality and interactivity in JavaScript.

The audio files for the piano were sourced from the [MIDI.js Soundfonts repository](https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts), allowing for a rich and authentic musical experience.
